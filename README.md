# MATLAB_PROJECT
This project focuses on importing a robot's Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) file
into MATLAB and enabling the robot to move on the ground. The objective is to simulate
the robot's motion in a controlled environment, providing a platform to test and analyze
various movement algorithms. By achieving this, we aim to bridge the gap between
theoretical robot design and practical implementation in a simulation environment.
